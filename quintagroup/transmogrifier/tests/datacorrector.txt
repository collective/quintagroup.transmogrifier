Data corrector section
======================

A data corrector section lets you use context sensitive components (adapters)
to do needed corrections in data generated in previous sections. The data
corrector section blueprint name is ``quintagroup.transmogrifier.datacorrector``.

Data corrector needs next information: the path to the object (context), the
key in item on which is stored contaired with data from previous sections and
sources -  list of keys in this container which points to data, that need to
be corrected. Every key in this list is also a name of adapter to lookup.

Adapter are of two types: ``export`` and ``import``. What to use is controlled
by ``type`` option, ``export`` is default value.

Paths to objects are always interpreted as relative to the context.
